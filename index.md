## About Me
My name is Handsome Zheng, a current Sophomore studying Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science at Columbia University. 

I am a driven and passionate sophomore currently pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. With a strong interest in AI, Robotics, and Machine Learning, I am eager to explore how cutting-edge technology can transform the world. My academic journey is complemented by hands-on experience in CAD (Computer-Aided Design), machining parts, and building engineering projects.

I love to work in team environments where collaboration, communication, and problem-solving are key. Outside of engineering, I enjoy art, working out, and traveling, which I believe all contribute to my creativity, well-being, and adaptability
